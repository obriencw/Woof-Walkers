## Technical Challenges

## For the Future
* Add functionality to be able to have multiple dog walkers and allow users to choose their dog walker.
* Allow users to customize their profile with a picture of their dog(s)
* Automate scheduling so that appointment scheduling does not overlap.
* Sync appointments with a user's calendar
* Add Google Maps API and java logic to determine if the user is within a maximum distance of an available 'walker'
